	    <p>The <b>Land Use Public Notification</b> application allows local government staff to identify properties within a given distance (buffer) of a subject property and generate mailing labels and/or a structured text file for owners and occupants that fall within the buffer.  This application is typically used by local planning and zoning officials, but can be used by any agency looking to notify property owners and occupants of a formal action being taken. The process of public notification allows adjoining or nearby property owners, and others, the opportunity to look at a proposed development, consider the likely impacts the proposal may have on them, and provide comment (either positive or negative) about the proposal prior to a decision being made.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The Land Use Public Notification application offers a simple way for applicants to find a subject property and select a set of properties by a given distance; or find a roadway and select a set of properties adjacent to that roadway. It provides a list of property owners and occupants for the selected set of properties in an Adobe PDF document that is formatted to match several standard Avery Label formats, and a simple common separated text file (.CSV) that can be used in a subsequent mail merge to produce the public notice.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are two primary ways to identify an area of interest, subject property, or roadway.  You can interact directly with the map and click on a subject property or roadway when you've located it. You can also use the Search Box to locate a subject property by address or parcel identification number or a roadway by name.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br /><br />1. Use the basemap switcher to select the basemap you'd like to interact with<br />2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br />3. Hold down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br />4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br />5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>The search box can be used to find a subject property or roadway:<br /><br />1. Select the search method you'd like to use<br />2. Enter the address, parcel identification number, or road name you're interested in<br />3. Click on the item in the list to locate the address, parcel identification number, or roadway on the map<br /><br />Note, you can enter a partial address, parcel identification number, or road name and then identify the correct value in the list.</p>
        <h4><u>Identify Surrounding Properties and Generate a Mailing List</u></h4>
        <p>You can identify surrounding properties and generate a mailing list once you've identified a subject property or roadway. Before you start the notification process, you can add neighboring parcels or road segments to your selection. To start the notification process, you'll need to:<br /><br />1. Click the Notify tab on the information popup<br />2. Enter the buffer distance (this will select every property that touches a buffer created from the perimeter of the subject property)<br />3. Select who you'd like to notify (Property Owners, Property Occupants, or both)<br />4. Select Download Avery labels in PDF format if you'd like to generate preformatted mailing labels in Avery 5160 or 5193 format<br />5. Select Download in CSV format if you'd like to generate a preformatted text file<br />6. Click Download<br />7. Select the Print button to generate a map of the selected properties</p>
        <h4><u>More Information</u></h4>
        <p>The <b>Land Use Public Notification</b> application can be used by planning and zoning, building, or other local government organizations to deliver a web-based public notification application.<br/><br/>The responsibility for distributing the public notices vary by local government.  In some cases, the petitioner may be responsible for distributing the public notices. In others, the local government itself will distribute the public notices to surrounding property owners. In either case, the Public Notification application provides a map and list of owners and occupants with appropriate addresses to be notified. In local governments that use technology during their planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or governing body's land use review process, the public notice may reference a website or application that contains details on the proposed development.  An example of such is the <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d8b5cd47ecfe47489548714502eb7969">Land Use Public Comment</a> application. If technology is not present, the public notice will typically reference a case number and direct the property owner to a public hearing date and/or the local planning office for more information. <br /><br />Please visit Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government Resource Center for more information.<br/></br/></p>
        <h4><u>Browser Compatibility</u></h4>
        <p>The Public Notification application is supported on the following browsers: Microsoft IE 7/8/9, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari.<br/></p>
        <h4><u>Label Alignment</u></h4>
        <p>If your labels are misaligned then, try adjusting your printer settings from “shrink to fit” to “actual page size”.  If your labels are still misaligned then, try editing the python script’s horizontal and vertical parameters to work with your printer.<br/></p>
